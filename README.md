Why Playwright?
I used Playwright because it is a standalone solution that supports all major browsers and different programming languages like Java, JavaScript and Python. Screenshots, videos and execution traces are supported out of the box.It is very fast and it comes with its own runner but can also be used with the runner of your choice like Cypress. Playwright allows multi tabs, origins and users within one test.Playwright has the adaptability to operate with third-party runners such as JUnit or Jest. This is not available with Cypress.
